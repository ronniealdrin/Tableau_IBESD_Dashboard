# Tableau_IBESD_Dashboard

I had the pleasure of coordinating the development of the IBESD - Brazilian Digital Economy and Society Index, which is the first Brazilian KPI on this topic. Its main objective is to map the Brazilian digital economy, offering subsidies to public policies and private companies to change the unequal way in which this economy and society develop throughout Brazil. Here I've created the Dashboard with the public data from this KPI.
